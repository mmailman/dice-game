* Michael Mailman
  This is my biggest foray into web development as a web developer. Coming from a background of QA/SDET testing and automation, I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing development from the developer perspective. I am finding that my background as an SDET has given me more of a awareness of quality that I try to apply to code to produce higher quality code.

* Keiran Beaton
  Keiran is brand new to web development, having been in sales previously. His hobbies include watching sports, talking about sports, arguing about sports, playing sports, and talking to his dogs. He also likes video games, but mostly just the sports ones. He is really enjoying his first experience in writing code, and is looking forward to furthering his code writing abilities.

* Sarah DeBey
Sarah is an aspiring developer from the Pacific Northwest. In her free time she likes to hike, camp, and do other outdoorsy things. She has a black lab husky mix named Piper who she is slightly obsessed with and who is often the theme of or at least mentioned in her coding projects, much like this one. She hopes to someday live far outside the city on a homestead of sorts and be able to make her living as a freelance web developer.
