  This is my biggest foray into web development as a web developer. Coming from a background of QA/SDET testing and automation, I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing development from the developer perspective. I am finding that my background as an SDET has given me more of a awareness of quality that I try to apply to code to produce higher quality code.
