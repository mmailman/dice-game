* Michael Mailman
  This is my biggest foray into web development as a web developer. Coming from a background of QA/SDET testing and automation, I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing development from the developer perspective. I am finding that my background as an SDET has given me more of a awareness of quality that I try to apply to code to produce higher quality code.

  Keiran is brand new to web development, having been in sales previously. His hobbies include watching sports, talking about sports, arguing about sports, playing sports, and talking to his dogs. He also likes video games, but mostly just the sports ones. He is really enjoying his first experience in writing code, and is looking forward to furthering his code writing abilities.
